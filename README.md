I made a modern football match info app built to practice a modernized full-stack workflow.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js** Cuz it's cool
- **tRPC** for typesafe APIs
- **TanStack Query** for data fetching
- **shadcn/ui** for easy implemented components
- **Radix UI** for accessible UI primitives
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- **Next-PWA** for installable Progressive Web App support
- **Docker** for containerization
- **Cloudflare** for DNS and SSL

## Features

- Live football match info
- Search with recent history
- Responsive, accessible UI
- PWA support (installable on mobile/desktop)
- Deployed with Docker, secured via Cloudflare

## Notes

I wanted to get hands-on experience with some modern libraries and tools using this full-stack setup mainly: tRPC, TanStack, shadcn/ui, Docker, and Cloudflare. They're a fun, efficient addition to my Next.js workflow.
